## Dependencies
The code is tested on MATLAB R2016b and R2018b.

## Code
This repository contains the needed MATLAB code to run the functions of "[Correlation-Based Deblurring Leveraging Multispectral 
Chromatic Aberration in Color and Near-Infrared Joint Acquisition](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/231919/files/CORRELATION-BASED%20DEBLURRING%20LEVERAGING%20MULTISPECTRAL%20CHROMATIC%20ABERRATION%20IN%20COLOR%20AND%20NEAR-INFRARED%20JOINT%20ACQUISITION.pdf)". Simply run `DEMO_multispectral_deblur.m`, it saves intermediate 
results in the folder `ResultsRGBY`. To obtain the correlation maps used in the paper's correlation study, use `corr2_across_patches.m`.

The code allows the deblurring of a spectral channel (red, green, blue, or NIR), given one or more other channels. This takes advantage of the chromatic aberration naturally present in captured images. The code relies on optimizations solved in the Fourier domain (see the second citation below).

The folder `Guided_Deblurring` contains the demo and code of "Multiscale Guided Deblurring: Chromatic Aberration 
Correction in Color and Near-Infrared Imaging". Simply run `demo.m`.

## Data
To test with different RGB-NIR image pairs, [this dataset can be downloaded](https://ivrl.epfl.ch/research-2/research-downloads/supplementary_material-cvpr11-index-html/).
Replace inside `Guided_Deblurring` the images `rgb.tiff` and `nir.tiff`.
